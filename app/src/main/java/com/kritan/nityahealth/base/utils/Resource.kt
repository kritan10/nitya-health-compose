/**
 * A generic helper class to bridge views and models.
 * It is used while retrieving data from a repository.
 * The response is sent to the composables notifying whether the call was successful or failed.
 * It is recommended to emit the corresponding objects from inside a [kotlinx.coroutines.flow.Flow] to correctly update the UI.
 *
 * It contains three sub-classes as follows:
 *
 * [Success] - notifies that the resource call was successful
 *
 * [Error] - notifies that there was an error while making the call
 *
 * [Loading] - notifies when the call starts and ends
